            <h3>Discover My Goal in Life</h3>
            <p>Our mission is to help people give meaning to their lives. By consciously thinking for one week about
                your
                life, we hope that you will discover your goal in your life.You can sometimes walk around with an
                unconscious need for meaning. This can be expressed in a sense of meaninglessness. You can find a
                short-term
                satisfaction in money, sex, drugs, music and sound, but sooner or later you discover that these are all
                temporary and do not offer lasting satisfaction.</p>

            <h2>Become A Junior Web Developer</h2>
            <p>It's no surprise that web developers are in high demand, and the field is growing much faster than
                average, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. If you're interested in becoming a web
                developer, you can do so with no experience.</p>

                <p>The pros of being a web developer include high pay, versatility in the work you enjoy, and high
                    demand
                    for the job so you can always find something to do. However, the cons include long hours, clients
                    who
                    don't always understand the work's scope, and ever-changing technology.</p>

                <p>Register a domain and let your web development skills get to work. Share your website with others
                    and
                    offer to build a site for others (you could start with family and friends; no experience is bad
                    experience). You will have the opportunity to add these projects to your portfolio.</p>
